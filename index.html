        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I love to travel, and my favorite trip was a week-long hiking trip in Colorado, where I explored beautiful trails and took in some amazing sights.</p>
        <p>I’m a huge sports fan and love getting in on the action! Whether I’m cheering for my favorite teams on TV or playing a pickup game with friends, I’m always ready for anything!</p>
        <p>I enjoy reading, and one of my recent favorites is "The Midnight Library" by Matt Haig. It really made me think about the choices we make in life and the possibilities that come with each decision.</p>
